# Python_CSV_Worker
Download CSV from URL, extract 5th column (ISBN), then upload new CSV to FTP server

This Python code is designed to execute the following steps:

1.) Download a CSV file from a URL.
2.) Extract the 5th column of the CSV file (in this case, an ISBN field).
3.) Create a new CSV file with the data in one column.
4.) Name the CSV with a specific naming convention that includes a time-stamp.
5.) Upload the new CSV file to a specific directory of an FTP server. 

Additional improvements can be made to this code by checking to see if the ISBN in fact exists in the 5th column.
